###Getting Started
You need to install node.js and run some lines of code to use this

###1. Install Node.js
Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

###2. Install dependencies
npm install

###3. Run the app
npm run dev

index.html is needed to create an actual page to show the user

package.json tells npm (Node Package Manager) how the project works and what scripts to run, which packages are used, etc.

package-lock.json is automatically created and updated by npm and locks the exact versions of this project's installed dependencies to make sure everyone gets the same working setup. This updates whenever npm install is ran or when package.json is changed. Make sure this is committed everytime it changes.
